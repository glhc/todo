# To-Do Ideas

## Project Overview

### Planning

### Features and Milestones

- Search feature (Maybe regex and update after every keypress)

### Github and GitHub Pages Setup

### Project Work

### Sections

#### Multiple lists

- Inbox
- Other, user-created lists
- Archive (gathering dust).  
  Tasks in this view have not had their parent list changed, but are found by asking for items older than 30 days.

#### Views

##### Assign Lists Colors

So that they can visually view their

##### View Options

Sort By:

- User arranged item order
- Date Due

##### Today View

A today view

##### Next 7 days view

Graphically present a heatmap of tasks (wider rectangle?)

## Frontend

### Animations

When create task, first simplified view, then detailed creation window.
  This could look like __immediate__ title fill inputtext line, and then a slide down panel asking for:
    - date due
    - List it belongs to

Maybe click and drag can be done with slideUp() and slideDown()
jquery has drag-drop functions
Dynamically expanding boxes, e.g. on task focus (e.g. click)

## Backend

Event hooks, triggering for sending notifications out to an API (don't develop, but for future)

### Constructors:

- Task constructor
  - Due date
  - Comments on task
  - Title
  - Description
  - Tags (#)
    - tags would probably go bold, right aligned underneath the task, especially when you focus(click) on a task.
- Accounts?

## Miscellaneous Ideas

- JSDoc
- JIRA
- Jest testing
- moment.js
