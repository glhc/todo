## Resources

- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) for extra css features.
- [Ethan Schoonover's Solarized colorscheme](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) library for manipulating the DOM.
- [UUID](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-uuid) JavaScript library. Generates unique IDs so that I can address & identify each task uniquely, even if all the other information is the same.
