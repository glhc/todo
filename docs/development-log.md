## Struggles

I don't know how to give each task a unique identifier.
I considered using the built-in Map() object and the built-in Set() object.
I also considered using some method of generating unique id's

My code got messy & bloated, so I had to delete a lot of dead code to make it cleaner.
My styling is difficult

Decided to use UUID to distinguish these things.
