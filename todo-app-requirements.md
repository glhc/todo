### Overview

For our first project lets start out with a practicle application.

**We'll be making a Todo app** an app that allows you to track tasks and check them off to be completed, you can **be creative** and design your app however you like. this project will have some really tough programming challenges to get your feet wet in the world of web development, and it could work on both desktop and mobile browsers.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

### What You've Learned

By the time you submit this project, you will have covered new ground in many of the big themes of the course:

- **Command Line**: Practice interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.
- **Source Control**: Manage and interact with a git repository to store changes to code.
- **Programming Fundamentals**: Work with array, objects, event handlers and callbacks, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors.
- **Web Fundamentals**:  Learn how communication happens over the internet, and how to structure, style, and animate documents within a browser. Also learn how to respond to actions your users take and the data they input into the browser.
- **Browser Applications**:  Dive into CSS, and how to use libraries and frameworks to get lots of style for free.
- **Deployment**: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment.
- **Products and Teams**: Document your code and your code repository so others understand what you've built.

### Big Goals

* **Build a web application from scratch**, without a starter codebase
* Use your programming skills to ** define data and application logic for your todo app**
* **Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files** in your application
* Build an application **to a spec that someone else gives you**
* **Craft a ``readme.md`` file that explains your app** to the world

---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Show the user a list of todos**
* allow for todo's to be "Created", "Updated" and "Deleted"
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Use **Javascript and JQuery** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your app online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

---

### Bonus

These are for extra credit! Don't focus on these until you've hit the core requirements.

* **Get inventive with your styling**, e.g. use hover effects, allow for drag and dropping to re-order todo's.
* **Use LocalStorage** to persist data locally to allow your app data to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity
* **Support realtime data storage**: https://www.firebase.com/ has a nice quickstart guide

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working app, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

---

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
* Work through the lessons in class, **ask questions and come to office hours** when you need to. Think about adding relevant code to your App each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Check out Tutorial and Documentation resources** (jQuery tutorial) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available.
