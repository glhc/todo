# To-Do App



## Resources

- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com) for extra css features.
- [Solarized color scheme](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) developed by Ethan Schoonover. SCSS theme code was lifted directly from the site.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) library for manipulating the DOM.
- [UUID](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-uuid) JavaScript library. Generates unique IDs so that I can address & identify each task uniquely, even if all the other information is the same.
